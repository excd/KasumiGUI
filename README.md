# KasumiGUI
A Discord bot made for fun and personal use. Themed around the character Kasumi from the game Kantai Collection.  
It will essentially be a total rewrite of an old bot of the same name I made back in 2016 using discord.js, but with a GUI and eventually more features.

Written in C# using Discord.NET and WinForms for the GUI.

This bot is still in early development.

## Usage
I do not host this bot publicly, but feel free to host it yourself or use it as a reference/base for your own bot.

A bot token must be added in either `App.config` in the source code before compilation (a template is provided, just delete .template from the file name) or `KasumiGUI.dll.config` in the same directory as the compiled executable.  
A default config with no token will be included in any release.
